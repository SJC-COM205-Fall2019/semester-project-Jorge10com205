    <h1>History of The World Cup</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1> The Beginning </h1>
    <p>The history of the world cup goes to 1914 before the world cup existed when FIFA agreed to recognize the Olympic soccer tournament as a “world football championship for amateurs”. FIFA managed the event and in the 1920 Summer Olympics the first Olympics after the First World War the tournament took place and was won by Belgium. The next two Olympics in 1924 and 1928 which were won by Uruguay started FIFA’s professional era and with the success of the Olympic tournaments FIFA wanted to make their own world championship. The first ever world cup would be held in Uruguay in 1930 where 13 nations competed and the host Uruguay would go on to win it. Eventually the world cup would become more prestigious then the Olympic soccer tournaments and even now the Olympic tournaments have a rule consist where most players are under the age of 23 and only a small limited amount can be over the age limit.</p>
    <h2> Early Issues and War </h2>
    <p>In the beginning many European nations were not willing to make the trip to go to Uruguay across the Atlantic and in the next editions that took place in Europe the South American nations also did not want to make the trip because of the cost. Another issue was the threat of war with the tensions at the time it eventually led to start of World War II and would lead to the cancelation of the 1942 and 1946 competitions. After the end of the second world war with Europe still affected by the war the tournament returned in Brazil in 1950 where Uruguay shocked the host who were the favorites and defeated them 2-1. </p>
    <h3>Expansion </h3>
    <p>As the tournament became more successful FIFA sought to expand the competition many times the first being in 1982 where it was expanded to 24 teams that qualify for the tournament and then again it expanded to 32 teams which is the current number of teams allowed. On January 10, 2017 FIFA confirmed that they were going to expand the competition for the 2026 world cup that will be held in Canada, Mexico, and the United States to 48 teams. Expansion of the tournament means more nations from different parts of the world have a chance to participate in the tournament and will bring lots of profit for the competition. However still has also let to a question of the level of competitiveness in the tournament decreasing with more nations participating that wouldn’t have in previous formats. </p>
